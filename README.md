# React About Me Project

## The App
This app allows users to create a "profile" about themselves. They can add their name, image and an about me paragraph. They can view other users as well. Users can be deleted. 


## Technologies Used
Node.js, Express.js, React, MongoDB(mLab), mongoose, Webpack, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, ajax

This single page application uses react to allow users to create and delete profiles without page refresh. Content persists in the database.


## Approach Taken
Before I began coding, I mapped out the following: 
1. User Stories,
2. ERDs,
3. Components
4. Wireframes,
5. A Plan of Action and Goals/Deadlines

## User Stories
* User comes to site
* User creates new profile
* User can view other users
* User can delete profile

## Installation Instructions
1. Fork and/or clone the repository to your local machine
2. Run `npm install` inside the directory to install all the dependecies used in this project.
3. Once the dependecies are installed, you can run `nodemon` in terminal and visit localhost:3000 to view the web app locally.
4. The website can be viewed online at https://reactaboutme.herokuapp.com/ as well.


## Unsolved Problems
Several features that were not implemented, but would be next steps:
* OAuth/Passport Auth
* Editing users
* Users can only delete/edit themselves (comes with Passport Auth.)
